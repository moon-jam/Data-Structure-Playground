        "desc": "Welcome! Let's start with the basics.\n\n**A Red-Black Tree** is a special type of \"Binary Search Tree\" (BST) that **automatically stays balanced**.\n\n💡 **What is a Binary Search Tree?**\nEach node has at most two children. Left child values are smaller, right child values are larger.\n\n💡 **Why do we need balance?**\nIf a tree grows lopsided (like a straight line), searching becomes slow. A balanced tree guarantees fast searches!\n\n**The Five Red-Black Tree Properties:**\n1. Every node is **red** or **black**\n2. The **root** is always **black**\n3. Every **NULL leaf** (empty child) is considered **black**\n4. **Red nodes' children** must be **black** (no Red-Red adjacency)\n5. All paths from any node to leaves have the **same number of black nodes**\n\n💡 **Important Concept: NIL Nodes**\nWhen a node has no left or right child, that position is considered an **invisible black NIL node**.\nThis matters because NIL nodes count when calculating \"black height\"!\n\n**Observe the example tree on the right, then click \"I Understand\" to continue.**"

      "colors": {
        "title": "The Meaning of Colors",
        "desc": "Now you know Red-Black Trees have two colors. But **why do we need colors**?\n\n**What colors do:**\n- **Black** nodes: Called \"stable\" nodes, like the tree's skeleton\n- **Red** nodes: Called \"flexible\" nodes, can be \"borrowed\" during adjustments\n\n**The most important rule: No Red-Red adjacency!**\n- If a red node's parent is also red, it's a violation\n- This rule ensures the tree doesn't grow too lopsided\n\n**Observe the example tree:**\n- Can you find any red node whose parent is also red?\n- If not, the tree is valid!\n\nIn later lessons, you'll learn how to fix \"Red-Red\" violations."

        "desc": "This is one of the most fundamental concepts in Red-Black Trees!\n\n**What is \"Black Height\"?**\nWhen you walk from a node down to any leaf, count the **black** nodes you pass. That count is the black height.\n\n💡 **Important: Leaf children (NULL) count as black!**\nEvery leaf node (with no children) has left and right child positions that are invisible but considered **black NIL nodes**.\nWhen calculating black height, these invisible NIL nodes count too!\n\n**Key rule: All paths must have the same black height!**\n- Starting from the root, whether you go left or right\n- Reaching any leaf, the number of black nodes passed is always the same (including the final NIL)\n\n💡 **Why does this matter?**\nThis rule ensures the tree isn't deep on one side and shallow on the other, guaranteeing search efficiency!\n\n**Practice:**\nLook at the tree on the right, try counting:\n1. From root, taking the leftmost path - how many black nodes?\n2. From root, taking the rightmost path - how many black nodes?\n3. The two numbers should be equal!"

Find a node in the tree\n2. Drag it left or right with your mouse\n3. Observe how the tree structure changes\n\nThis skill will be used frequently in later lessons!"
